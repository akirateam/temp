# acm_search_util Role

This role provides tasks to query the Red Hat ACM Search API using the `oc search` command from within an Ansible Execution Environment. It's designed to be included by other roles or playbooks that need to collect information about managed clusters via the ACM Hub.

**Requirements:**

* `oc` binary installed and accessible in the Execution Environment's PATH.
* Ansible collections: `openshift.redhat`, `kubernetes.core`.
* Connectivity from the Execution Environment to the ACM Hub API endpoint.

**Role Variables:**

* `acm_hub_url` (Required): The API URL of the Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management Hub cluster (e.g., `https://api.your-acm-hub.example.com:6443`).
* `acm_user` (Required): Username to authenticate with the ACM Hub. This user needs permissions to perform Search queries.
* `acm_pass` (Required): Password for the ACM Hub user. **Use Ansible Vault to encrypt this variable in production.**
* `search_query_base` (Optional): The base search query string (defaults to `kind=ManagedCluster Infrastructure.Cloud=Azure`). Overwrite for specific resource searches.
* `search_query` (Required when overriding base): The full search query string (overrides `search_query_base` if provided).
* `target_cluster_name` (Optional): The name of a specific managed cluster to filter search results (e.g., `my-managed-cluster-pr-01a`). If omitted, the search applies across all clusters visible to the ACM user (filtered by `search_query_base`).
* `environment_label_filter` (Optional): A label selector string to filter results by environment (e.g., `ambiente=dv`, `ambiente=ho`). Applies in addition to `search_query_base`.

**Outputs:**

* `acm_search_results` (Fact): A list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a resource found by the `oc search` query in JSON format. This variable is set as an Ansible fact and is available in the playbook that includes this role.

**Example Usage (within another role or playbook):**

```yaml
# Example 1: Get all ARO clusters in the 'ho' environment
- name: Get HO ARO Clusters via ACM Search
  ansible.builtin.include_role:
    name: acm_search_util # Assuming acm_search_util is in your roles path
  vars:
    acm_hub_url: "{{ acm_hub_api_variable }}" # Get from Survey/Workflow vars
    acm_user: "{{ acm_admin_user_variable }}"
    acm_pass: "{{ acm_admin_password_variable }}" # Use Vault!
    # Using defaults for search_query_base (ManagedCluster Infrastructure.Cloud=Azure)
    environment_label_filter: "ambiente=ho" # Filter by label

- name: Debug the retrieved HO clusters
  debug:
    var: acm_search_results

# Example 2: Get Deployments in a specific ARO cluster
- name: Get Deployments in a specific ARO cluster via ACM Search
  ansible.builtin.include_role:
    name: acm_search_util
  vars:
    acm_hub_url: "{{ acm_hub_api_variable }}"
    acm_user: "{{ acm_admin_user_variable }}"
    acm_pass: "{{ acm_admin_password_variable }}" # Use Vault!
    search_query: "kind=Deployment apiVersion=apps/v1" # Overwrite base query for specific resource
    target_cluster_name: "name-of-your-dv-cluster" # Filter for a specific cluster
    # environment_label_filter is not needed here if filtering by cluster name is enough
